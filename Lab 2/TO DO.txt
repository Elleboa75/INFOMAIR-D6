Change the dialog act prediction model to the Neural network one

Make the system more robust:
 - If a user wants to change in preference
 - Change the diagram if needed
 - Make it more robust to different dialog acts
 - KeyError when inputting a value that is not yet known

Clean up the code
 - Add comments
 - Make it more dynamic (a lot is hard coded)
